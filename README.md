## Modular Combat Platform
The Modular Combat Platform is an all-in-one solution for creating modular combat oriented objects in Unreal Engine that need to
literally be the sum of their parts. Developers are equipped to specify the stats of their creation with modular pieces, whether it
be a spaceship or a castle. It is highly extensible for custom implementations.
