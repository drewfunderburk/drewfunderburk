# About Me
I'm Drew Funderburk, a Unity and Unreal programmer! I'm currently working on a stealth action first person shooter in Unreal 5. I frequently work in Perforce, so please excuse any lapse in commit history!

I am looking for work! If you have any availabilities and think I would fit your team well, please email me at drewfunderburkbusiness@gmail.com.

## Projects
#### Stratus
Stratus is a 6 month project created in Unreal Engine 4 intended to show proficiency with Unreal Engine and expand the scope of
the team's planning and project organization understanding. Not including planning, this project has seen 3 months of actual
development time thus far. <br/><br/>
The team consisted of two programmers and three artists, with myself as lead programmer and project lead. <br/><br/>

#### Proximo One
Proximo One is a 9 week Unity project intended to demonstrate competence in Unity as well as familiarize the team with a
complete development cycle starting with project planning and ending with release. Not including planning, this project was
completed in one month. <br/><br/>
The team consisted of myself as programmer and project lead, and another artist working together. <br/><br/>

#### Modular Combat Platform
The Modular Combat Platform is an all-in-one solution for creating modular combat oriented objects in Unreal Engine that need to
literally be the sum of their parts. Developers are equipped to specify the stats of their creation with modular pieces, whether it
be a spaceship or a castle. It is highly extensible for custom implementations. <br/><br/>

#### Alex and Alex
One of the first game jam games I completed with a team in 2018. Alex and Alex was created in one week in Unity. <br/><br/>
