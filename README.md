Based on the new feature film, MALUM, Flock of the Low God VR immerses gamers in the horrifying world of the "The Flock", and pits them against an onslaught of cult members and creatures as they attempt to breach the confines of Lanford Police Department. Put on the badge, grab a weapon, and fight off The Flock and the entities they've conjured before it's too late. Play alone, or gather your friends, and prepare for a combat-based VR survival horror experience like no other.

## Modular Combat Platform
The Modular Combat Platform is an all-in-one solution for creating modular combat oriented objects in Unreal Engine that need to
literally be the sum of their parts. Developers are equipped to specify the stats of their creation with modular pieces, whether it
be a spaceship or a castle. It is highly extensible for custom implementations.
